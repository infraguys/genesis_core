"""Build the OpenAPI documents this project publishes.

A document describes the code that is loaded and not the data a service
holds, so building one needs neither a database nor a service listening on a
port: walking the route tree of an application object produces the document
that service would answer ``/specifications/{version}`` with. That is what
this module does, and it is why the documents are generated when the site is
built instead of being kept in the tree, where they were a megabyte of
derived text that went stale whenever the generator moved.

Three things reach for request state while the tree is walked, and each is
answered here with what the published document is meant to describe:

  - IAM controllers read the caller's introspection when they are
    constructed;
  - field permissions ask the enforcer whether a field is visible, so a
    document is only as complete as the rights of whoever asked for it. The
    published one is the complete one, so every rule is granted here -- the
    same document an administrator was served when these files were built by
    calling a running service;
  - three element controllers load the element registry from the database
    when they are constructed. The document is built with an empty registry,
    which is what the committed documents were built with as well: they came
    from a service started against a freshly migrated database.
