"""Write the table of resource types a manifest may declare.

Every row is read out of `full_spec.yaml`, so the page says what the
installation would actually accept. Run before building the documentation;
nothing else reads these pages.

Both languages are written here because the table is the same table in
either: it was translated by hand once and then drifted, ending up five
resource types short and still listing one that no endpoint has served.
