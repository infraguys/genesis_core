# Upgrade the core of a running installation and wait for it to come back.
#
# Usage: upgrade-core.sh <new-version>
#
# The core replaces its own image and reboots, and there is no way back if the
# new image cannot be fetched: the update data is moved off the data disk
# before the download is attempted, so a failed download leaves a machine that
# boots into an updater with nothing to apply.  The installation here is
# disposable, but the preconditions are still checked up front so that a
# failure says what went wrong instead of hanging until the job times out.
