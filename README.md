Welcome to Genesis Core!

The Genesis Core is an open source software that offers a one turnkey solution to deal with infrastructure at all levels - from bare metal and virtual machines to applications and services.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/infraguys/genesis_core/wiki) for more detailed information.


# üì¶ Installation 

There are several ways to install Genesis Core and depend on your purpose you can choose one of them.

## Try it out
