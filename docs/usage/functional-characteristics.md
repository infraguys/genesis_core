Exordos Core is an open-source software platform (NoOps) for automating the deployment, management, and operation of IT infrastructure and enterprise software. The platform is designed for use in local, private, public, and hybrid environments.

## 1. Purpose and scope

Scope of application:

- Automation of deployment and management of virtual machines and physical servers.
- Declarative management of configurations, secrets, variables, and profiles.
- Lifecycle management of elements (applications and infrastructure components).
- Access and user permission management (IAM).
- Load balancing and DNS management.
- Deployment and update of applications in an image-based environment.

## 2. Functional modules

The platform includes the following functional modules.

### 2.1. Compute module

Provides creation and management of virtual machines (KVM/QEMU) and physical servers.

- Creation, configuration, and deletion of virtual machines (Node).
- Grouping of nodes into NodeSet with a target replica count (`replicas`).
- Image-based provisioning: compute nodes are created and updated from images; during an update, the root disk is replaced with the target image while attached volumes and network identities are preserved.
- Management of hypervisors (Hypervisor) and storage pools.
- Node placement policies (PlacementPolicy).

### 2.2. Storage module

Provides creation and attachment of disk volumes (Volume) for persistent data storage.

- Creation of volumes with a specified size and type.
- Support for multiple disks per node (root disk + data disks).
- Attachment and detachment of volumes to compute nodes.

### 2.3. Network module

Provides management of network resources.

- Creation and configuration of network resources.
- Management of node network connections.
- Support for routing and project network isolation.

### 2.4. DNS module

Provides management of DNS resources through a built-in DNS server based on CoreDNS.

- Creation and management of DNS domains.
- Creation of DNS records of types A, NS, SOA, TXT.
- Synchronization of domains with external DNS (ecosystem DNS).

### 2.5. Load Balancer module

Provides nginx-based load balancing.

- Creation and management of load balancers (LB).
- Support for virtual hosts (Vhost) with HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP protocols.
- Backend pools with the `roundrobin` balancing algorithm.
- Prefix-based and L4 (raw) routing.
- Support for TLS termination (HTTPS).

### 2.6. IAM module (Access management)

Provides management of users, roles, and access permissions.

- "Deny by default" model — access is explicitly granted through permissions.
- Management of users (User), organizations (Organization), projects (Project).
- Roles (Role) and permission bindings (Permission Binding, Role Binding).
- Global and project-scoped role bindings.
- Token introspection for access permission verification.
- Support for wildcard permissions (`*.*.*`).
- User types: `user`, `service`, `anon`.

### 2.7. Secrets module

Provides storage and management of confidential data.

- Password management: automatic generation (`AUTO_HEX`, `AUTO_URL_SAFE`) and manual values (`MANUAL`).
- TLS certificate management: automatic issuance through ACME (Let's Encrypt) with DNS-01 verification via the built-in CoreDNS.
- Management of SSH keys and RSA keys.

### 2.8. Configs module

Provides delivery of configuration data to compute nodes.

- Creation of configuration files with text content.
- Delivery of files to target nodes with specified path, owner, and access permissions.
- Automatic configuration update when related values change (link tracking).
- Actions on change: `no_action`, `shell` (e.g., service restart).

### 2.9. Services module

Provides management of system services on compute nodes.

- Creation and management of systemd services on nodes and NodeSet.
- Service types: `simple`, `oneshot`, `monopoly`, `monopoly_oneshot`.
- Lifecycle management: start, stop, update.
- Dependencies between services (After, Before).

### 2.10. Values Store module

Provides management of variables, values, and profiles.

- Variables (Variable) with profile binding (`develop`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `legacy`).
- Selector variables with value binding support.
- Values (Value) — concrete data bound to variables.
- Profiles (Profile) — sets of values for different deployment scales.

### 2.11. Element Manager module

Provides installation, update, and lifecycle management of elements.

- Installation of elements from a manifest (YAML).
- Dependency resolution between elements (requirements).
- Import and export of resources between elements.
- Update of elements with state preservation.
- Deletion of elements with dependency checking.
- Continuous reconciliation of declared and actual state (reconciliation loop).

### 2.12. Marketplace module

Provides public and private element catalogs.

- Discovery and installation of elements from catalogs.
- Public catalogs for element distribution.
- Private catalogs for corporate elements.
