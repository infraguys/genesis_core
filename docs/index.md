## Application Developer Guide

Everything you need to develop and deploy applications on the Exordos Core platform. In platform terminology, applications are called **elements**. The guide covers all stages of the element lifecycle:

- **Writing a manifest** — defining the element structure, its dependencies and configuration.
- **Building** — packaging the element and its artifacts.
- **Publishing** — releasing the element to the ecosystem registry.
- **Deploying** — installing and running the element on the platform.
