Welcome to Exordos Core!

**Exordos** is an open-source NoOps platform for managing infrastructure at every level, along with the ecosystem built on top of it.

## 📦 Installation

### Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repository.genesis-core.tech/install.sh | sudo sh

## 🚀 Application Developer Guide

Everything you need to develop and deploy applications on the Exordos Core platform. In platform terminology, applications are called **elements**. The guide covers all stages of the element lifecycle:

- **Writing a manifest** — defining the element structure, its dependencies and configuration.
- **Building** — packaging the element and its artifacts.
- **Publishing** — releasing the element to the ecosystem registry.
- **Deploying** — installing and running the element on the platform.
