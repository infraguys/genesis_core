# Certificates

Certificates are a part for the Secret Manager service. The service allows to issue and manage certificates, store them in specified storage and use them for different purposes.

The current implementation only support `dns_core` method (provider) to issue and manage certificates. This method supposed DNS challenges via Core DNS that is
available from the internet.

Examples:

```bash
curl --location 'http://10.20.0.2:11010/v1/secret/certificates/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "my-cert",
    "project_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "method": {
        "kind": "dns_core"
    },
    "constructor": {
        "kind": "plain"
    },
    "email": "user@exordos.com",
    "domains": ["test0.cdns.exordos.com"]
}'
```

The main fields are:

- **name** - name of the certificate.
- **project_id** - it's a project the certificate belongs.
- **method** - the method (provider) to issue and manage the certificate.
- **constructor** - In the context of the certificates, the constructor object creates and stores the certificate. The `plain` means create and store in the plain format.
- **email** - the email address to use for the certificate.
- **domains** - the list of domains to use for the certificate.

Also it's possible to specify domains with wildcards.

```bash
curl --location 'http://10.20.0.2:11010/v1/secret/certificates/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "my-cert",
    "project_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "method": {
        "kind": "dns_core"
    },
    "constructor": {
        "kind": "plain"
    },
    "email": "user@exordos.com",
    "domains": ["*.test1.cdns.exordos.com", "test1.cdns.exordos.com"]
}'
```

## Methods / Providers

The Exordos Core supports the following methods / providers to issue and manage certificates:

### dns_core

The `dns_core` provider allows to issue and manage certificates via Core DNS. It means Core DNS service should be available from the internet to accept ACME challenges. The main logic to communicate with Let's Encrypt is implemented in the [GCL CertBot plugin](https://github.com/infraguys/gcl_certbot_plugin) look at it for more information but the main steps are:

- Create or get private client key.
- Initiate a client with the key.
- Request a certificate for domains.
- Pass the DNS challenge.
- Some final preparation.
